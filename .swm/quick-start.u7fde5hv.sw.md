Lottie loads and renders animations and vectors exported in the bodymovin JSON format. Bodymovin JSON can be created and exported from After Effects with [strongbodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin), Sketch with [strongLottie Sketch Export](https://github.com/buba447/Lottie-Sketch-Export), and from [strongHaiku](https://www.haiku.ai/).

Lottie-iOS looks to `UIImageView` for its API. The basic API is broken into two parts:

*   `Animation` - The backing model for an animation that is deserialized from a json file.

*   `AnimationView` - A `UIView` subclass responsible for loading and rendering the `Animation`

You can quickly load a Lottie animation with:

```
let starAnimationView = AnimationView(name: "StarAnimation")
```

Additionally you can choose to load an `AnimationView` without any animation, and set the animation later:

```
let starAnimationView = AnimationView()
/// Some time later
let starAnimation = Animation.named("StarAnimation")
starAnimationView.animation = starAnimation
```

You can load animations from a specific bundle, a filepath, or even asynchronously from a URL. Read more about loading animations

After loading an animation it can be played with:

```
starAnimationView.play { (finished) in
  /// Animation finished
}
```
