## **Why is it Called Lottie?**

Lottie is named after a German film director and the foremost pioneer of silhouette animation. Her best known films are The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926) â€“ the oldest surviving feature-length animated film, preceding Walt Disney's feature-length Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) by over ten years.

File github issues for anything that is broken. Be sure to check the [**list of supported features**](https://airbnb.io/lottie/#/ios?id=supported-after-effects-features) before submitting. If an animation is not working, please attach the After Effects file to your issue. Debugging without the original can be very difficult.
