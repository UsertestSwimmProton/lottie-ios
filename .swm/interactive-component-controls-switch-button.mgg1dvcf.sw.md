## Animated Control

Lottie comes prepacked with two Animated Controls, `AnimatedSwitch` and `AnimatedButton`. Both of these controls are built on top of `AnimatedControl`

`AnimatedControl` is a subclass of `UIControl` that provides an interactive mechanism for controlling the visual state of an animation in response to user actions.

The `AnimatedControl` will show and hide layers depending on the current `UIControl.State` of the control.

Users of `AnimationControl` can set a Layer Name for each `UIControl.State`. When the state is change the `AnimationControl` will change the visibility of its layers.

## Animated Switch

An interactive switch with an 'On' and 'Off' state. When the user taps on the switch the state is toggled and the appropriate animation is played.

Both the 'On' and 'Off' have an animation play range associated with their state.

To change the play range for each state use:

```
/// Sets the play range for the given state. When the switch is toggled, the animation range is played.
public func setProgressForState(fromProgress: AnimationProgressTime,
    toProgress: AnimationProgressTime,
    forState onState: Bool)
```

## Animated Button

An interactive button that plays an animation when pressed. The `AnimatedButton` can play a variety of time ranges for different `UIControl.Event`. Play ranges are set using either:

```
/// Set a play range with Progress Time.
public func setPlayRange(fromProgress: AnimationProgressTime, 
    toProgress: AnimationProgressTime, 
    event: UIControl.Event)
/// Set a play range with Marker Keys.
public func setPlayRange(fromMarker fromName: String, 
    toMarker toName: String, 
    event: UIControl.Event)
```

Once set the animation will automatically play when the event is triggered.

Example:

```
/// Create a button.
let twitterButton = AnimatedButton()
twitterButton.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
/// Set an animation on the button.
twitterButton.animation = Animation.named("TwitterHeartButton", subdirectory: "TestAnimations")
/// Turn off clips to bounds, as the animation goes outside of the bounds.
twitterButton.clipsToBounds = false
/// Set animation play ranges for touch states
twitterButton.setPlayRange(fromMarker: "touchDownStart", toMarker: "touchDownEnd", event: .touchDown)
twitterButton.setPlayRange(fromMarker: "touchDownEnd", toMarker: "touchUpCancel", event: .touchUpOutside)
twitterButton.setPlayRange(fromMarker: "touchDownEnd", toMarker: "touchUpEnd", event: .touchUpInside)
view.addSubview(twitterButton)
```
